# AES-Algorithm-Using-verilog-128bit
With the advent of easily available high-speed computers there has been an increase in demand for effective methods to secure data despite what processing power an adversary may possess. Older cryptographic methods, such as DES, do not have a large enough key space to lend themselves to applications where high security is needed. To remedy this situation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) created a competition to select the next generation encryption standard. The method that was selected was a design proposed by Joan Daemon and Vincent Rijman, which they called Rijndael. The Rijndael algorithm, or as it is now known, the Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) provides a symmetric key cryptography that allows for the encryption and decryption of fixed size blocks of data. As a symmetric system, the secret key must be shared between the sender and receiver for communication to be possible.
